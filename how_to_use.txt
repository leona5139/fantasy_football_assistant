### DRAFTING: ###
#################
The goal is not to provide an absolute answer of who to draft, but instead to act as an additional point of information.
Ideally, both the greedy and the mcts approach would be run simultaneously to give you two points of reference on who to select.
This does however mean keeping track of players for both, but in the downtime of opponents picks, you should be able
to manage.

### MANAGING: ###

This application is actually split into two parts: play/sit and add/drop decisions.

It is usually better to do the add/drop decision first, and this tool is designed to help you notice players 
on your team that are trending downwards and players on the waiver wire that are trending upwards. Based on that
information, you can then make a decision of who to add and drop. This part focuses on longer term trends to find
valuable players for the entire season.

Next you can make the play/sit decision. This decision focuses more on the short term returns and is meant to alert
about players who may have signs of performing differently than their projections. It can also give information about
the riskiness of different player choices to help you determine if you want a relatively safe team or a more boom/bust lineup.
This tool can also be used to analyze the opponent's team to understand what their performance might look like.
